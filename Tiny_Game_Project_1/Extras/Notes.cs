        //      Game loop doesn't function as multiple 'u' appear. 
        //      FIXED 10/01/26 - instead of removing the "u" and replacing with "o" we store the first map and clone it at beginning & reset.


        //      Same for the Y/N continue screen.
        //      Loop works but now it doesn't display the y/n text after you die without hitting enter.

        //      create logic for player                             -Done
        //      create logic and simple ai for enemy - the 'z'      -Done
        //      player to spawn in top start zone                   -Done
        //      create start and end zones                          -Done
        //      any other key causes crash, during play with wasd   -Done

        //      add music                                           -Done (needs fixing)
        //      add lives                                           -Done (needs fixing, doesn't decrement lives) 
        //      would you like to try again Y/N.                    -Done (needs fixing, errors out if second time running through.)
